# Operational Excellence Assessment - Software Development and Quality Assurance
## Question: How do you optimize software development and quality assurance processes?

It's important to have a build process up and running the first day of your product development. High-performing teams use industry-proven tools and processes to minimize wasted effort and potential code errors. As code is developed, updated, or even removed, having an intuitive and safe method to integrate these changes into the main code branch enables developers to provide value.

## Question Responses

### [X] **We rely on industry-proven tools and solutions to support the entire development lifecycle.**
Highly effective engineering teams adopt best-in-class tools. Wherever feasible, they rely on off-the-shelf tools to support all aspects of their implementation cycles.
#### Comments


**NOTE - **


### [X] **We have a style guide to standardize writing, reviewing, and documenting code.**
A standard style makes collaboration easy and helps with on-boarding new developers. To work effectively, new developers need to know how the workload team operates. A style guide with clearly defined standards can ease their training process.
#### Comments


**NOTE - **

### [X] **We perform unit testing early and often throughout the development process.**
Frequent testing in each development environment helps developers gain confidence in their applications. They treat test implementations as an integral part of the development process, following the same standards as for production code.
#### Comments


**NOTE - **

### [X] - **We strategically incur and address technical debt in our development teams.**
Adopt a mindset that technical debt is intentional and necessary for your workload team's deliverables. This mindset motivates your team to consider and address technical debt regularly to avoid accumulation. Address technical debt as a regularly recurring task in the backlog.

**NOTE - **

### [X] **We have a versioning standard for all artifacts.**
For release management as well as troubleshooting, it's essential that all artifacts have well-defined versions and that each asset exposes insights about its versions using respective interfaces, such as REST endpoint or a special table in your database. Wherever appropriate, you consistently use the same version identifiers across different services.

**NOTE - **

### [X] **We have standards for naming and tagging.**
Tagging and naming conventions help to identify, classify, and group resources based on common attributes, such as environment, application, owner, or cost center.
