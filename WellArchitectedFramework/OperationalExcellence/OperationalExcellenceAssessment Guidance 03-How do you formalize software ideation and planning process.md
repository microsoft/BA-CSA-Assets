# Operational Excellence Assessment - Software Ideation and Planning
## Question: How do you formalize software ideation and planning process?

Your team's ability to produce high-quality software relies on a structured, collaborative approach to development planning. Product owners and managers must be able to clearly understand and articulate to stakeholders the work that developers are doing at any time in a development cycle. Conversely, developers must understand the goals of the development cycle via well-written features, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
