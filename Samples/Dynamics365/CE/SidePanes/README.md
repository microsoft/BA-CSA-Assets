# Client API and Side Panes

## Summary

Model Driven and Dynamics 365 API provide developers the ability to extend forms and views to the side pane. This feature can be extended to include many different panes showing views, forms, etc.

## Setup and Samples

From the official documentation, to work with side panes we need to work with the Client API.

The documentation here shows how to work with the API but not how to implement.

To implement, I went through the following steps:

1. Create a **new solution**
2. Create **two new web resources**
   1. JavaScript file called **sidepanes.js**
   2. Png file called **sample_product_icon**
3. Created a **new command** in a model driven app.
4. **Referenced the function** within sidepanes.js from the button command.
5. **Published**.



Once published I have the following button:

The button press opens the side pane as shown:
